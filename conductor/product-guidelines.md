# Product Guidelines: mybatis-dynamic

## 1. Prose Style

The prose style for all documentation, user-facing content, and in-code comments should be **Technical and Precise**. Given that the primary audience is experienced Java developers, the content should prioritize accuracy, clarity, and comprehensive technical detail.

*   **Clarity over Brevity:** While conciseness is valued, it should not come at the expense of clarity. Complex concepts should be explained thoroughly.
*   **Assume Technical Competence:** The audience is expected to be familiar with Java, Spring Boot, and general ORM concepts.
*   **Consistent Terminology:** Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation. Refer to the project's core concepts (e.g., "Dynamic Model," "Model Service," "Data Manager") consistently.

## 2. Brand Messaging

The core message of `mybatis-dynamic` is to **empower developers to build data-centric applications faster and with more flexibility**. The framework should be positioned as a powerful tool that enhances productivity and simplifies database interactions in a dynamic environment.

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic, Flexible, Powerful, Productive, Seamless Integration.
*   **Tone:** Confident, knowledgeable, and helpful.

## 3. Visual Identity

While `mybatis-dynamic` is a code library, its `draw` module provides a visual interface. The visual identity of this tool should be:

*   **Clean and Minimalist:** The UI should be uncluttered and focus on the visualization of the model relationships.
*   **Informative:** The visualization should be easy to understand and provide clear insights into the data model.
*   **Professional:** The overall look and feel should be professional and polished.

## 4. API Design Principles

The public-facing API of the framework should adhere to the following principles:

*   **Intuitive and Discoverable:** The API should be easy to learn and use, with a logical and predictable structure.
*   **Fluent and Expressive:** The querying API should be fluent and allow developers to write expressive and readable code.
*   **Well-Documented:** All public APIs should have clear and comprehensive Javadoc documentation.
*   **Backward Compatibility:** Strive for backward compatibility between minor and patch versions. Any breaking changes must be clearly documented in the release notes.
